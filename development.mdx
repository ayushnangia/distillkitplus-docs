## Development Setup

If you plan to contribute to `DistilKitPlus` or need a development setup, follow these steps after cloning the repository:

1.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:** Install the core requirements and the package in editable mode.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -e .
    ```

<<<<<<< HEAD
3.  **Install Development Dependencies (Optional):** If you plan to run tests or linters, you might need additional dependencies (specify if a `dev-requirements.txt` or similar exists).
    ```bash
    # pip install -r dev-requirements.txt # Example if dev dependencies exist
    ```
=======
```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify
```

Now you can modify the source code in the `components/` or `scripts/` directories, and your changes will be reflected when you run the scripts, thanks to the editable install.

## Code Structure Overview

*   **`components/`**: Contains the core reusable modules of the library:
    *   `dataset.py`: Handles dataset loading, processing, and logit integration.
    *   `models.py`: Manages model and tokenizer loading, PEFT configuration, and quantization.
    *   `trainer.py`: Defines the custom `LogitsTrainer` for distillation.
    *   `loss.py`: Implements various distillation loss functions.
    *   `formatters.py`: Provides functions to format data before tokenization.
    *   `config.py`: Helper for loading JSON configurations.
*   **`config/`**: Contains example configuration files (`.json`) and potentially templates for Accelerate/DeepSpeed.
*   **`scripts/`**: Contains executable scripts for running tasks:
    *   `local/`: Scripts intended for local execution (e.g., `distill_logits.py`, `generate_logits.py`).
    *   `modal/`: Scripts adapted for execution on [Modal](https://modal.com/) (if applicable).
*   **`setup.py`**: Standard Python package setup file.
*   **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the core dependencies.
*   **`README.md`**: Project overview and basic usage.
*   **`ROADMAP.md`**: Outlines planned features and future development directions.

=======
Please note that each CLI release is associated with a specific version of Mintlify. If your local website doesn't align with the production version, please update the CLI:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```


```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Validating Links

The CLI can assist with validating reference links made in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
mintlify broken-links
```

## Deployment

<Tip>
  Unlimited editors available under the [Pro
  Plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing) and above.
</Tip>

If the deployment is successful, you should see the following:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/checks-passed.png"
    style={{ borderRadius:"0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

## Code Formatting

We suggest using extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX. If you're a VSCode user, consider the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>
    This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:

    1. Remove the currently-installed version of mintlify: `npm remove -g mintlify`
    2. Upgrade to Node v19 or higher.
    3. Reinstall mintlify: `npm install -g mintlify`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error">
    Solution: Go to the root of your device and delete the ~/.mintlify folder. Afterwards, run `mintlify dev` again.
